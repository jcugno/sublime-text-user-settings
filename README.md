SublimeTextUser
===============

My SublimeText settings and my attempt not lose them + provide portability

These go in:
~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User

1. Install Sublime Text (3)
2. Install Sublime Package Control - https://packagecontrol.io/installation
3. Delete the User folder in the above location
4. `git clone https://github.com/Jojo-Jojovich/sublime-text-user-settings.git User`
5. Load sublime back up and it freaks out. Close and reload until it stops

I have no idea why #4 above is the case, but eventually it does work after a minute
or so, which means I haven't had enough of a problem with it it look into it further ;)
